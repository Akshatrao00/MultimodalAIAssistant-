# MultimodalAIAssistant-
A Python-based assistant that uses voice, text, and image inputs.
# 🤖 Multimodal AI Assistant

A smart, Python-based assistant that can take input through **Voice**, **Text**, and **Image**, and respond intelligently. Inspired by JARVIS — this assistant combines AI, NLP, speech, and vision into one project.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🎙️ Voice input using speech recognition
- 💬 Text-based conversation
- 🖼️ Image input and analysis (vision-based AI)
- 🧠 NLP processing and intelligent response generation
- 🔊 Text-to-speech responses
- Modular structure (easy to scale)

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- `speech_recognition`
- `pyttsx3`
- `transformers` (for text AI)
- `OpenCV` / `cv2` (for image/vision tasks)
- `tkinter` / custom GUI (optional)

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Multimodal-AI-Assistant.git
cd Multimodal-AI-Assistant
````

2. Install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python main.py
```

Make sure your mic and speaker are working for voice mode. Image input needs a webcam or image file.

---

## 📌 Example Use Cases

* Ask it questions through voice like “What’s the time?”
* Send it a picture to analyze (e.g., detect faces or objects)
* Type your queries and get chatbot-style replies

---

## 🧠 Future Upgrades (Coming Soon...)

* Wake word detection (“Hey AI”)
* Emotion detection via face & voice
* Integration with APIs (weather, GPT, home automation)
* Chat history with memory
